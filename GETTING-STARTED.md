# Getting Started 

## Test Environment
The ScribbleDemo sample requires Xcode 10 or higher.

To test the application, a Wacom tablet driver must be installed and a supported Wacom tablet must be attached. All Wacom tablets supported by the Wacom driver are supported by this API. Get the driver that supports your device at: https://www.wacom.com/support/product-support/drivers.

## Install the Wacom tablet driver and verify tablet operation
In order to run a sample application, it is necessary to install a Wacom tablet driver. The driver can be found at: https://www.wacom.com/support/product-support/drivers.

Once the driver has installed, and you have rebooted your system, check your tablet driver installation by doing the following:

1. Attach one of the supported Wacom tablets. 
1. Either open the Wacom Tablet System Preferences, or the Wacom Desktop Center to determine if your tablet is recognized by the driver.
1. Use a tablet pen to see if you can move the system cursor.
1. If all of the above checks out, proceed to the next section to build/run the sample application.

## Build/run the sample application
To build the sample application:

1. Open the ScribbleDemo.xcodeproj file in Xcode 10 or newer.
2. Select ScribbleDemo in the files list, then select the ScribbleDemo target.
3. Change the bundle identifier and signing settings as appropriate for your development.
4. Press Xcode's Build and Run button.
